> So... why the hell are you starting this blog?

Great bloody question, mate! The truth is, I much too often awaken in a cold sweat after dream bubbles filled with fingers *clickity-clack-clacking* away in a dull grey enclosure appear above my head. Really though, I'm just beginning to realize that I need to start contributing to the community in some way. I more or less started feeling this way after watching the course [Get Involved!](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/get-involved/) (highly recommended) by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) and [Rob Conery](http://rob.conery.io/).

I'm also moving to small mountain town with no programmers inside a 40 mile radius, so I need to start building a presence online so I can pick up some more remote work.

Hey, nothing wrong with a little honesty right?

> Okay that's... great? So what kind of content can I expect?

I really don't know! Good things come to those who wait! All I can say at this point is, expect a lot of rants about the philosophy of software, business, and life. That's my bread-and-butter, now don't you forget it. Having said that, I'll of course try and keep them topical and constructive. I also like teaching, so I'm going to put up a fair amount of tutorial-style and *discovery* posts on programming and computers as I come across new ways of doing things. Some things I imagine I'll write about eventually are:

1. Ruby and Rails
2. Object-oriented design and development
3. Software as a service
4. How much I hate Microsoft (sometimes)
5. How great Vim is and how I know nothing about Emacs

> Okay, okay. Will you shut up and get writing?

Certainly, certainly. I'm pretty booked up for the next couple of days, but I'm trying to think of ideas for my first real post so stay tuned! Yes, I realize that I have zero readers!
