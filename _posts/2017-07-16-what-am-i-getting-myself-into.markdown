> So... why the hell are you starting this blog?

Great bloody question, mate! The truth is, I much too often awaken in a cold sweat following dream-bubbles of fingers *clickity-clack-clacking* away in a dull grey enclosure. Really though, I'm just beginning to realize that I need to start contributing to the community in some way. I more or less started feeling this way after watching the course [Get Involved!](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/get-involved/) (highly recommended) by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) and [Rob Conery](http://rob.conery.io/).

> Okay that's... great? So what kind of content can I expect?

I really don't know! Good things come to those who wait! All I can say at this point is, expect a lot of rants about the philosophy of software and business. That's my bread-and-butter, now don't you forget it. Having said that, I'll of course try and keep them topical and constructive. I also like teaching, so I'm going to put up a fair amount of tutorial-style and *discovery* posts on programming and computers.
